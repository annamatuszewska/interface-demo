## Data Prep

The data preparation process uses the `data_prep_new_esac.R` script located in the `data` folder.  
This script processes musical works in **.krn** and **EsAC** formats stored in the `data_prep` subfolder and converts them into CSV files.  
After processing, the script merges the outputs into ready-to-use tables.

The resulting files — **combined_data.csv**, **lyrics.csv**, and **lyrics_with_metadata.csv** — are then used by the application located in the `app` folder.

*Note: The data files included in this repository are limited due to platform restrictions.  
If you need access to the full datasets, please contact the author.*
